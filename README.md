# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

[Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

This is my solution for a challenge made in Frontend Mentor's website. This is not completely responsive because tt was only adapted to two screen sizes: 1330px, 970px and 375px.
